## Step 1: 

Clean everything. RNA prep is on the far side of the lab.

## Step 2: 

Set up equipment.
- Ultra pur DEPC treated Water
- Zymo research DNA/RNA kit
- Monarch Kit
- Aliqout out 50 ml of 100% EtOH for sample prep
- Pipette tips
  - 10-20 ul 
  - 200 ul
  - 1000 ul
- Racks
  - 2 purple 1.5 ml tube
  - 2 cold PCR tube racks
  - 1 orange falcon tube holder
- 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes
- 15 ml falcon tubes

## Protocol

### Stage 1: Sample prep

1) Add 96 ml of 100% EtOH to each tube
2) Add 1040 uL Proteinase K storage buffer/vial to reconstitute Proteinase K @ 20 mg/uL and vortex to mix

* All centrifuge steps 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds unless defined otherwise
* All steps performed at room temperature unless defined otherwise

### Solid Tissue Prep

1) Add DNA/RNA shield (1x) to a solid tissue sample
   - homogenized or non-homogenized
   - for animal tissue </= 50 mg add 300 uL of DNA/RNA shield
2) For every 300 uL of sample (DNA/RNA shield) add 15 uL of PK digestion buffer and 7.5 ul of Proteinase K
3) Mix well then incubate at 55 C until tissue dissolves
   - incubated for 1 hour
4) After incubation, vortex sample and centrifuge @ max speed for 2 mins
   - transfer supernatant into new RNase free tube
5) Add equal volume of DNA/RNA lysis buffer and mix well.m 

### Stage 2: Column Purification

Column purification has two major pathways for DNA purification and RNA purification. This Stage will be broken up into those two sections. It is important to note that you can either finish DNA purification and then move to RNA purification or do them both simultaneously. It is recommended that you first conduct them stepwise in order to reduce the number of moving parts you first few times doing the extraction.

1) Transfer sample into Spin-away filter (yellow) in a collection tube and centrifuge @ max speed @ 30 sec
** CAUTION: SAVE FLOW THROUGH  in new 1.5 or 5 ml tube**

#### DNA purification
2) Transfer spin-away filter into new collection tube
   - continue to transfer volume into collection tubes until all sample has been added
3) Add 400 uL of DNA.RNA prep buffer to column and centrifuge. Discard flow-through
4) Add 700 uL of DNA/RNA wash buffer to column and centrifuge. Discard flow-through
5) Add 400 uL of DNA/RNA wash buffer to column and centrifuge for 2 min. Discard flow-through
    - carefully transfer column to new labelled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
6) Add 100 ul of DNase/RNase free water directly to column. Let stand for 5 mins then centrifuge for 1 minute

#### RNA purification
2) Add 1 volume of 100% Ethanol to the flow through from 1). Transfer RNA sample to Zymo spin IICG tube (green) in a collection tube and centrifuge. Discard flow through
3) Add 400 uL of DNA.RNA prep buffer to column and centrifuge. Discard flow-through
4) Add 700 uL of DNA/RNA wash buffer to column and centrifuge. Discard flow-through
5) Add 400 uL of DNA/RNA wash buffer to column and centrifuge for 2 min. Discard flow-through
    - carefully transfer column to new labelled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
6) Add 100 ul of DNase/RNase free water directly to column. Let stand for 5 mins then centrifuge for 1 minute

### Experiment 

#### Stage 1: Sample Preparation

Samples: All 40 um blue filters

Some math for calculating DNA/RNA shield and Proteinase K and Buffer amounts

* 2000/300 = 7
* 1500/300 = 5
* 3000/300 = 10
* 100/300 = 3.3
* 10 x 30 uL 300 uL
* 5 x 30 uL = 150 uL
* 3.3 x 30 uL = 95 uL
* 7 x 30 uL = 210 uL
* 7 x 15 uL = 105 uL
* 3.3 x 30 = 
* 3.3 x 15 = 
* Note: Have 5 ml, use 1ml, 1000 uL buffer & PK digest
* 6.66 x 15 = 200 x 4 = 800 uL (A+B)
* 3.33 x 15 = 100 x 2 = 200 uL
* Note: Have 1040 uL, use 500 ul Proteinase K (what??)
* 6.66 x 
* 3.33 x 7.5 = 50 uL x 2 = 100 uL, 500 uL ?
* There are other small mathematics but disregard
  
A) 2 into 50 ml falcon tubes (easy)
B) 2 into 50 ml homogenizer tubes
C) 2 into 5 ml tubes

1) Add DNA/RNA shield
   A) Add A1, Add A2
   B) Add B1, Add B2
   C) Add C1, Add C2
2) Cut filters out using scalpel blade
3) A1A2 (24 K) B1B2 (24K) add 50 uL Proteinase K and 100 uL of PK buffer. C1C2 (24K) sample add 50 uL Proteinase K buffer and 25 uL Proteinase K. A3 (24K) add 50 uL Proteinase K  buffer and 25 uL Proteinase K
4) Incubate Mix

#### Stage 2: Purification

1) Transfer 700 uL at a time to column
2) Centrifuge at 15,000 rcf for 30 sec
   - save flow through, it has RNA

#### DNA purification
2) Transfer spin-away filter into new collection tube
   - continue to transfer volume into collection tubes until all sample has been added
   - held DNA column for a while
3) Add 400 uL of DNA.RNA prep buffer to column and centrifuge. Discard flow-through
4) Add 700 uL of DNA/RNA wash buffer to column and centrifuge. Discard flow-through
5) Add 400 uL of DNA/RNA wash buffer to column and centrifuge for 2 min. Discard flow-through
    - carefully transfer column to new labelled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
    - some liquid was touching the bottom of the column
6) Add 100 ul of DNase/RNase free water directly to column. Let stand for 5 mins (sttod for 8 mins) then centrifuge for 30 sec at 15,000 rcf

#### RNA purification
1) Add 2 mL of 100% Ethanol to the flow through from. Transferred 800 uL x5, centrifuged and then discarded flow through until all sample volume was gone. Proceed to DNase step
2) DNase step
   1) Wash column with 400 uL of DNA/RNA wash buffer
   2) Added 80 uL of DNase rxn mix to each tube.
   3) Incubate for 15 minutes
   - Can do DNA purification while waiting for this to incubate
3) Add 400 uL of DNA.RNA prep buffer to column and centrifuge. Discard flow-through
4) Add 700 uL of DNA/RNA wash buffer to column and centrifuge. Discard flow-through
5) Add 400 uL of DNA/RNA wash buffer to column and centrifuge for 2 min. Discard flow-through
    - carefully transfer column to new labelled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
6) Add 100 ul of DNase/RNase free water directly to column. Let stand for 5 mins then centrifuge for 1 minute

Purification for DNA and RNA done

7) Store samples in less than -75 C. Samples are in small refrigerator

### Qubit RNA

Qubit Protocol

1) Mix 1 uL dye with 199 uL of buffer per samples. EX: 7 samples 2 standards 9 tubes. 9 uL dye 1791 uL buffer
2) add 190 uL / standard
3) add 199 uL / sample
4) add 1 uL of sample to sample tubes

Note:
1) Standards are in small fridge
2) 10 uL / standard
3) After adding all samples quickly vortex
4) Air bubbles can really mess with readings
